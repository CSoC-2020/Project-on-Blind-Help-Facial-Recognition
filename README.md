# Project-on-Blind-Help-Facial-Recognition
 facial recognition.. 

But it could be tested on a blind person.. 
The camera just updates the image of a person mention his/her identity like a ios camera 

So a speaker is conmected to it which will report the blind person what is in front of him  as anyone identified or not or may be a thing by judging its shape and updating it everytime
